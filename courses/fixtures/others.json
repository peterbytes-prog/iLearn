A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Exploratory data analysis has been promoted by John Tukey since 1970 to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA), which focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing, and handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed. EDA encompasses IDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Tukey defined data analysis in 1961 as: &quot;Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.&quot;[2]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tukey&#39;s championing of EDA encouraged the development of statistical computing packages, especially S at Bell Labs. The S programming language inspired the systems S-PLUS and R. This family of statistical-computing environments featured vastly improved dynamic visualization capabilities, which allowed statisticians to identify outliers, trends and patterns in data that merited further study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tukey&#39;s EDA was related to two other developments in statistical theory: robust statistics and nonparametric statistics, both of which tried to reduce the sensitivity of statistical inferences to errors in formulating statistical models. Tukey promoted the use of five number summary of numerical data&mdash;the two extremes (maximum and minimum), the median, and the quartiles&mdash;because these median and quartiles, being functions of the empirical distribution are defined for all distributions, unlike the mean and standard deviation; moreover, the quartiles and median are more robust to skewed or heavy-tailed distributions than traditional summaries (the mean and standard deviation). The packages S, S-PLUS, and R included routines using resampling statistics, such as Quenouille and Tukey&#39;s jackknife and Efron&#39;s bootstrap, which are nonparametric and robust (for many problems).</p>"
